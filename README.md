Created by Blake Merryman on 11/17/13 at Middle Tennessee State University for MATH 4310: Numerical Analysis

Description of Program:
This is a command line tool designed to approximate the integral of a function
along a given interval using the method of Simpson’s Rule adaptively. The
function definition is hard coded into the implementation file and the interval’s
start & stop points are entered into the function main manually. The error
tolerance that is used to test whether the current approximation is good enough is
also entered manually. The approximation value is outputted to the terminal via NSLog.
